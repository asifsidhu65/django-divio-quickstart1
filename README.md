A Dockerised Django project, ready to deploy on Divio

This version uses Python 3.8 running and the most up-to-date version of Django 3.1.

For a complete how-to guide for this project, see [Deploy a new Django project using the Divio quickstart
repository](https://docs.divio.com/en/latest/how-to/django-deploy-quickstart/) in the [Divio Developer
